# Traveling Salesman
Create a cli tool that finds the shortest route for the traveling salesman to take!

<br/>

## Backstory
Let's suppose this map represents the world you live in, and you are a traveling salesman. You begin at one city, load up on supplies. then you visit each city to sell your items there, and finally you return home.

To go from any one city to another has a cost (think of it as gasoline used, or hours traveled, etc). The goal is to write a function that takes:

1) the city you need to begin and end with, and
 
2) this matrix of costs for traveling between cities.

<br/>

## The Exercise
It's up to you how you want to structure the input to this function. You want to feed in the information about distances from one city to another, along with the starting/ending city.

The function should output 1) the order of cities to in the most optimal path (or paths), and 2) the total travel cost of the entire path. Good luck! ⭐️

<br/>

## Tests
Unit test the pure logic functions here!

Once you find the optimal route, create an integration test that asserts the correct route and length is calculated!  
<br/>

## Skills Practiced

- Working with weighted node/edge style graphs

- Deciding how to structure abstract data

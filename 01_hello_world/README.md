# Hello, World!
A barebones project that just prints the text "Hello, World"!

<br/>

## Backstory
Imagine you want to make the simplest Rust project possible- just the stuff needed to make a Rust project run.

The idea here is that if you can write a Rust project that compiles, runs, and does _something_ then you can build off this to create all the things you could ever imagine! ðŸŒˆ

<br/>

## The Exercise
Write the simplest Rust project possible that prints some form of, "Hello, World!" to the console. 

<br/>

## Tests
The general pattern for where to put tests is Rust is that unit tests should 

It's up to you to decide if / how you would unit test this, but it would be nice to at least have one integration test that asserts that the correct output was printed to the console.

## Skills Practiced

- Installing and using `cargo`

- Creating a `main` function

- Creating an integration test

- Running a Rust project and tests

<br/>

## Bonus

- Add some documentation to your own README file describing the different commands people who run when developing and testing your project.

- Deploy your cli tool to cargo and/or npm so others can install it! (hint for this: check out [rust-to-npm](https://github.com/a11ywatch/rust-to-npm))

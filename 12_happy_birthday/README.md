# Happy Birthday
Create a cli tool that wishes you happy birthday _and_ tells you how many days are left until your birthday!

<br/>

## Backstory
Imagine you love celebrating your birthday and planning ahead for it. You often want to know how many days are left until your birthday, but it's annoying always having to do the math of calculating how many days are left.

In this project we'll create a cli tool that will accept a birthday date and responds with the number of days to wait.

as the input and respond with the number of days it is from the current date.

<br/>

## The Exercise
The exercise is to create a cli tool that accepts a date and prints to the console the number of days between that input date and the current date.

The number of days should be calculated as a positive integer.

If the number of days is zero, print "Happy Birthday!! ðŸ¥³" to the console.

## Tests
It's up to you to decide how you would unit test this code.

Create some integration tests that correctly responds with the number of days away for the user's birthday.

Create at least one integration test where the cli tool correctly prints "Happy Birthday".

# Agile Standup
Create a cli tool that collects each person's status for a dev team's daily standup meeting!

<br/>

## Backstory
Imagine you want to automate the morning standup meeting so everyone can input their contribution asynchronously. 

<br/>

## The Exercise
The exercise is to create a cli tool that accepts a date and prints to the console the number of days between that input date and the current date.

1) what you worked on yesterday

2) what you are working on today

3) if you have any blockers

The text input can be collected either via cli args, flags, or through interactive q/a components.

For this example, just print the final user submission to the console.

<br/>

## Tests
It's up to you to decide how you would unit test this code.

Create at least one integration test that sends the necessary inputs and asserts the proper output is printed to the console.

## Skills Practiced

- Accepting large text blocks as input

- Building a cli tool that could actually be useful!

<br/>

## Bonus

- Store this information into a database

- Allow everyone to see all submissions for a team!

- Support _both_ args / flags inputs _and_ q/a components- prompt use to interactively enter required information not provided via args or flags. 

- Allow input to optionally be read from a text file to make things even easier for the user
